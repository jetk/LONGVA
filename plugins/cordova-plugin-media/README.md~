# cordova-plugin-media

This is my forked copy of cordova-plugin-media. I extended the Android source code to enable it to record lossless WAV audio. It's a little messy and a work in progress, but it works.
I didn't change the source code for any other platform at all, so if you're looking for lossless recording on iOS, blackberry, whatever, look elsewhere.

    cordova plugin add /path/to/wherever/you/cloned/this/repo/cordova-plugin-media

## Supported Platforms
